If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider
adding your user to the "docker" group with something like:
> sudo usermod -aG docker vitor

Remember that you will have to log out and back in for this to take effect!

Initiating docker
> /etc/init.d/docker start

Find docker
> ps -ef | grep docker

Information about containers running
> docker ps

Information about images
> docker images 

Instaling first image
> docker run -i -t ubuntu:14.10 /bin/bash

Getting out of the container, without killing it (Ctrl + D):
> Ctrl + P + Q

Getting back in containder
> docker attach CONTAINER-ID 

Verifying alterations on your docker
> docker diff CONTAINER-ID
